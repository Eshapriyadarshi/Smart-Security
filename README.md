# Smart Security Using Speech Analysis
Violence and crime are like an epidemic in India. Felonious activities like theft, crime against women, robbery, assault is perpetually increasing and many of the times these cases even go unreported. However, technology has been progressively taking the front seat to curb these situations. Mobile devices play one of the major roles here providing communication means which can be used to monitor and alert about violent situations. However, current solutions, like panic buttons or loud alarm and flashing lights from wearable smart devices or SMS alert through cell phones have lots of loopholes that might increase the loss of life in such situations. Thus, our aim is to provide a smart Embedded AI solution using Natural language processing which detects the violent situation and alerts the specified contacts with a complete real time location tracking of the victim along with the recorded audio clip of the crime scene which helps them to determine the urgency of the situation and take further steps.
